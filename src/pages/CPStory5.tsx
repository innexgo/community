      title="Free Mask Spacers"
      blurb="Mr. Pham discovered the wonderful mask spacers and supplied them to staff members. 
      He had 50 spacers and gave about 10 to staff, while the rest went to students. He did not ask students for money, but said if they would like to donate a dollar, he would use it to buy more spacers to continue giving them out for free. Most students who did pay ended up giving him $2 to ''pay it forward''. One student (Jacob Kong, freshman) gave him $10 to make sure more students can get them. These teens are so thoughtful, kind, and empathetic."
